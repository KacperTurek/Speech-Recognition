# Speech-Recognition

In this project I'll show you my own code designed to recognize voice commands that can be used in smart home. The code is written in Python and and uses various packages such as numpy or librosa. Plotly package is used only to present the results in most transparent way. Machine learning is done using SVC function from SKlearn package. I tried others functions from this package, but SVC gave the most satisfying results. This code isn't prerfect and more work needs to be done. It's planned to improve extracting of the features from audio signals and also to use TensorFlow. 

Enjoy and every feedback is welcome.
