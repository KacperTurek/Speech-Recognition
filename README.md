# Speech-Recognition

In this project I'll show you my own code designed to recognize voice commands that can be used in smart home. The code is written in Python and and uses various packages such as numpy or librosa. Plotly package is used only to present the results in most transparent way. Machine learning is done using SVC function from scikit-learn package. I tried others functions from this package, but SVC gave the most satisfying results. This code isn't prerfect and more work needs to be done. It's planned to improve extracting of the features from audio signals and also to use TensorFlow. 

Before you head to the notebook make sure you've got all necessary packages installed. If you're missing some of them use these commands.

```javascript
pip install librosa
pip install plotly 
pip install scikit-learn
```
or
```javascript
sudo pip install librosa
sudo pip install plotly
sudo pip install scikit-learn
```
To install scikit-learn you need to have Python newer than 3.3, nupmy newer than 1.8.2 and SciPy newer than 0.13.3.

Every feedback is welcome.
Enjoy.
